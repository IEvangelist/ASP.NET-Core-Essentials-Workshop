After continuing you'll be prompted to select the type of application. Please select the __API__ option and ensure that the __Docker Support__ checkbox is checked. As the for the purpose of this workshop - that is all we'll need.

You should have a working application at this point. To ensure that you've done this correctly, from the top menubar of __Visual Studio__ select the application name in the dropdown as the launch target - then press <kbd>F5</kbd> or select start debugging. This should compile and launch your application.

![Build Debug](/1-introduction/file-new/images/build-debug.png?classes=border,shadow)

Did it compile successfully, did it launch a command line and not report any errors?

> __Awesome, you're doing great!__

You can terminate the application, we'll continue on to the next chapter now.
