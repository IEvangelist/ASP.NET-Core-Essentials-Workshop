This workshop includes labs and various exercises intended to familiarize yourself with __ASP.NET Core Essentials__. With that being stated, please have the following software and tools installed before starting:

 {{% notice warning %}}
While it is possible to use a different integrated development environment, such as __Visual Studio Code__ with some of the various plugins available for C# and .NET - I must warn you that this workshop was specifically designed with __Visual Studio__ proper in mind.
