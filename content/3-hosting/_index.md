### Hosting

# All Applications Need A Host

> ASP.NET Core apps configure and launch a host. The host is responsible for app startup and lifetime management. At a minimum, the host configures a server and a request processing pipeline. <cite><a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/?view=aspnetcore-2.2' target='_blank'>Microsoft - ASP.NET Core Docs Team</a></cite>
