# ASP.NET Core Essentials - Developer Workshop

Welcome and thank you for joining me. In this workshop we're going to cover the vast majority of the concepts that are considered first class citizens of ASP.NET Core. As a workshop participant you should expect to learn about ASP.NET Core Program and Startup Conventions, Configuration, Dependency Injection, Middleware, Routing, Logging, Security and much more.

We will not spend any time learning MVC or HTML returning endpoints. Instead, we'll focus more on the core capabilities and building blocks that ASP.NET Core have to offer.

## Brief History of ASP.NET

Active Server Pages (ASP) has been around for a long time...Classic was originally introduced in 1996. We've come a long way since then, with dramatic improvements along the way. In 2002 ASP.NET Framework was released alongside version 1.0 of the .NET Framework. Fast forward 13 years in 2015 and ASP.NET 5, later re-branded ASP.NET Core was born.
