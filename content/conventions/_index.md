### Conventions

# Common Nomenclature

As previously mentioned, there is no longer a `Global.asax` or `App_Start`. A lot of the various ways of initially configuring and launching an application have been modernized. In this chapter we'll explore the `Program` and `Startup` classes as it relates to a new common nomenclature. Expect to end this chapter with a clear understanding of how the runtime will invoke named functions.
