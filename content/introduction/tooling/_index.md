## Tooling

This workshop includes labs and various exercises intended to familiarize yourself with __ASP.NET Core Essentials__. With that being stated, please have the following software and tools installed before starting:

 - <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017' target='_blank'>Visual Studio</a> (>= 2017, Community Edition is suitable)
 - <a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download' target='_blank'>.NET Core SDK</a> (>= v2.2, the SDK includes the runtime)

 {{% notice note %}}
While it is possible to use a different integrated development environment, such as __Visual Studio Code__ with some of the various plugins available for C# and .NET - I must warn you that this workshop was specifically designed with __Visual Studio__ proper in mind.
