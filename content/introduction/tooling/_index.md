## Tooling

This workshop includes labs and various exercises intended to familiarize yourself with __ASP.NET Core Essentials__. With that being stated, please have the following software and tools installed before starting:

| Tool | Version | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017' target='_blank'>__Visual Studio__ <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> | 2017 (or newer) | The __Community Edition__ is suitable, but if you have the __Enterprise Edition__ that is great too |
| <a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download' target='_blank'>__.NET Core SDK__ <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> | 2.2  (or newer) | The __SDK__ includes the required __.NET Core Runtime__ |
| <a href='https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/' target='_blank'>__Docker Desktop__ <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> | 2.0.0.2  (or newer) | This is required as we cover this as potential __Hosting__ option |

 {{% notice warning %}}
While it is possible to use a different integrated development environment, such as __Visual Studio Code__ with some of the various plugins available for C# and .NET - I must warn you that this workshop was specifically designed with __Visual Studio__ proper in mind.
